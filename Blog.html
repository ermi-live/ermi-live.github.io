    <p><strong><em>We humans are meant to live with humans</em></strong>. Every human being has a unique behavior and mindset that differ him/her from other humans.Today I want to share with you all something about our humanly internal natural need to chat
        with fellow humans. As a programmer I sit the whole day on the computer to code, as a result I <strong><em>sometimes feel emotionally drained</em></strong>. There I realize that chatting with the colleagues at the tea-break time refreshes my emotionoal
        makeup. Thus, <strong><em>even a small chat with a fellow human will have a positive effect in your humanly emotional stability </em></strong>that inturn results in good and healthy relationship with fellow humans and also results a calm feeling
        and focused mind. Our relationship with fellow humans can have an indirect effect on our work success too.Therefore, during the tea-break time have a small chat with your colleagues and that will refresh your mind and gives you a boost in doing
        your work with a relaxed feeling and focused mindset.This will inturn also save you from the burn-out of your hard and busy work style.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Healthy relationship with our fellow humans will always have a good and long lasting positive impact on our emotional wellbeing</em></strong>. This healthy communiction instinct is our human makeup that helps us to live in harmony with
        our families, friends and felllow humans in general.This form of communication, that is having a chat with friends or other people makes you refreshed and motivated to continue live your life in the positive direction . This small chat will also
        helps you to work in team with a good vibe that makes you and others to be successful in achieving the desired results in the job with out even costing you your emotional health.Therefore, <em>always <strong>take a Break and Refresh your mind</strong> with a small chat inorder to recharge your emotional energy</em>.I,myself,
        make appointments to meet up with friends for a talk and refreshment. Talking with people on a daily basis in all sorts of walks of life will help us to stay active in social life and emotionally healthy despite of our highly stressing and busy
        work life. </p>
    <p>Every small chat done on daily basis brings you closer to other people and rewards you with an imaginable emotional satisfaction. So take advantage of the small talks whenever you meet up with people everywhere,because they will certainly lead you
        to a really magnificient relationship with people who are present around you. Every healthy chat will have a positive change in allsides of your life style.</p>
